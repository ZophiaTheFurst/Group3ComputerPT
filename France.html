              <div>
                The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, has serious celeb status. Completed in March 1889, it's one of the most recognizable monuments in the world. And the site, which is also known as the Iron Lady, receives nearly seven million tourists a year.
                The Eiffel Tower is made almost entirely of open-lattice wrought iron. Gustave Eiffel used his advanced knowledge of the behavior of metal arch and metal truss forms under loading to design a light and airy but strong structure that presaged a revolution in civil engineering and architectural design. Its height and unique silhouette floating above the Paris landscape quickly made the Eiffel Tower one of the most popular attractions in Paris. The Tower's destiny is closely linked to that of the city of Paris, the capital of France and the Eiffel Tower's owner.
